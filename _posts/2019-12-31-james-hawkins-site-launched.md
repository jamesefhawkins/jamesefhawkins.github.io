Hello World!

I thought it'd be fun to put together a blog. I found that I often feel like writing but blogging as a company means you need a certain degree of uniformity.

Purpose:

* Clarify and memorialise thinking on a broad range of topics.
* Enjoy using Markdown and vim to create stuff.

Details:

* It is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
* It uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) so is hosted for free.
* Jonathan McGlone seems to have the best [Jekyll Tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for someone trying it for the first time, if you want to try it yourself.
