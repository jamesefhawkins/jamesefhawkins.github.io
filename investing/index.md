I invest from time to time. There are two things I consider, I feel like the first is most important:

* a team I think are really strong
* a product idea that I am really excited about

I do this inbound only, I don't have time to dig very deep. I make same day decisions.

## Investments to date

* Converge (as hedgehog.vc - a hackathon project to make a VC firm that we scrapped after as it was distracting!)
* Resend
* Fella Health
* Infisical
* Deepnote

## Areas I am useful in

* Deciding what to build / product strategy
* Finding PMF
* Inbound
* Brand
* Dealing with developers (working with them or getting them to like you online)
* Dealing with enterprise sales
* Creating principles for your business
* I can talk you through fundraising but don't consider myself an expert
* Putting my face on your deck so you seem more credible!

## How I can't help very much

* Setting up outbound sales
* Paid marketing
* Events
* Intros (I just notice I rarely am able to really make useful ones for whatever reason)
* Hiring

## Getting in contact

I don't have much time to put into investing - shoot me an email and give me a good idea of what you do!
