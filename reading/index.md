I decided I'd start tracking what I read so I can become more purposeful. I think I've erred on the side of reading "output" based books historically, and this is an attempt to focus on improving my ability to think from first principles instead.

## Biographies

### Alexander the Great

In progress. Thoughts so far: story-led approach. Very readable.

## Growth

### Traction, Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares

Gives a nice framework with tons of practical examples from leading companies. Tactical advice that doesn't deal in the hypothetical.

### Hacking Growth, Morgan Brown and Sean Ellis

Not bad, but a fluffier version of the above. The anecdotes are more generic and ones you're more likely to already know.

### Blitzscaling, Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh

Demonstrates what true ambition can look like.

## Product

### The Mom Test, Rob Fitzpatrick

Worth a very quick read for anyone that has any interest in product at all. Makes on fundamental point, but it's critically important to working out if your idea is a good one.

### Hooked, How to build habit forming products, Nir Eyal

Simple concepts, lots of good practical examples.

### Inspired, Marty Cagan

A less good version of the above - found it a bit repetitive.

## Raising

### Secrets of Sand Hill Road, Scott Kupor

A good fundamental grounding in how VCs think. Click-baity title, but it worked for me.

## Travel

### Blood River, Tim Butcher

A journalist's solo trip through the Congo. Sad but engrossing.

### Sheila in the Wind, Adrian Hayter

The author documents his journey in a 100 year old yacht from the UK to Australia, without a motor. The boat in this story is the sister of my wife's family's boat, so it was an interesting personal read.

## Sport

### Born to Run, Christopher McDougall

A fascinating first-principles approach to running in action.

### The Extra Mile

A list of non-chain restaurants within 1 mile of the motorway, across the UK.
