I decided I'd start tracking what I read so I can become more purposeful. I think I've erred on the side of reading "output" based books historically, and this is an attempt to focus on improving my ability to think from first principles instead.

## Biographies

### Alexander the Great

Achieves an incredible empire by the time he's 30. Leaves you simultaneously impressed but very conflicted about the means.

### Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products

I learned _much_ more about how Apple's design team actually works by reading this than Steve Jobs' bio. Specifically: (i) what it means to be design-led, and (ii) what it meant to Apple to be a product-led company, focussing on that as an input then just growing a ton of revenue "automatically". Going to read more about executives versus CEOs in future.

### Dapper Dan, Daniel Day

Harlem hustler turned the creator of high end street fashion. His shop never closed. Read to learn about hustle and resourcefulness. A vivid insight into his life in NY.

## Design

### Design as Art, Bruno Manari

Made me wish I had a Japanese house.

### book of branding, Radim Malinic

A good initial overview on how to achieve strong branding in practise, with a lot of case studies. It felt a little too much like paying for a portfolio but was helpful.

### The Designer's Dictionary of Colour, Sean Adams

Rebranding? Worth thinking about palette choice more deeply.

### The Design of Everyday Things, Donald A. Norman

A must read for design principles. I'll never see doors, light sockets or electric cars the same way.

### Visual Grammar, Christian Leborg

Clarifies the terms used in visual design, a very quick read but useful if you collaborate with designers regularly.

## Growth

### Traction, Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares

Gives a nice framework with tons of practical examples from leading companies. Tactical advice that doesn't deal in the hypothetical.

### Hacking Growth, Morgan Brown and Sean Ellis

Not bad, but a fluffier version of the above. The anecdotes are more generic and ones you're more likely to already know.

### Blitzscaling, Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh

Demonstrates what true ambition can look like.

## Management

### Creativity, Inc, Ed Catmull

The process behind Pixar's repeated creativity.

### No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention, Reed Hastings

Didn't agree with everything - more clarity for repeated decisions would drive more efficiency and less stress, but the way he runs the business like a sports team - distributed decision making, paying top of market and generous severance - and the tactics to build a culture of feedback resonated.

### Amp It Up, Slootman

The CEO of Snowflake. Main learnings (i) the importance of being a driver rather than a passenger (you want drivers) (ii) people need to care about their work - ask them if they're ecstatic about it, if not - revisit (iii) don't care what your board thinks - push everyone to grow faster (iv) you're not optimizing for popularity.

## Product

### The Mom Test, Rob Fitzpatrick

Worth a very quick read for anyone that has any interest in product at all. Makes on fundamental point, but it's critically important to working out if your idea is a good one.

### Hooked, How to build habit forming products, Nir Eyal

Simple concepts, lots of good practical examples.

### Inspired, Marty Cagan

A less good version of the above - found it a bit repetitive.

### The Cold Start Problem, Andrew Chen

Describes how Uber works. Discusses Network effects in depth. Main learnings (i) Networks go both ways - they can collapse (ii) you need to figure out if demand drives supply or vice versa (iii) start by figuring out what your network MVP is - what's the easiest way to build a network with value

## Raising money

### Secrets of Sand Hill Road, Scott Kupor

A good fundamental grounding in how VCs think. Click-baity title, but it worked for me.

## Sport

### Born to Run, Christopher McDougall

A fascinating first-principles approach to running in action.

## Travel

### Blood River, Tim Butcher

A journalist's solo trip through the Congo. Sad but engrossing.

### Sheila in the Wind, Adrian Hayter

The author documents his journey in a 100 year old yacht from the UK to Australia, without a motor. The boat in this story is the sister of my wife's family's boat, so it was an interesting personal read.

### The Extra Mile

A list of non-chain restaurants within 1 mile of the motorway, across the UK.
