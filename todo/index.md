This is a notepad for things I want to do with this site, and will make more sense to me than to you:

## Posts I want to write
* <strike>The mental workload of hoovering</strike>
* <strike>2019 decision analysis</strike>
* First-principle based reading
* Why isn't evolutionary psychology a thing
* Content marketing survivorship bias

## Other
* Set up local Jekyll deployment
